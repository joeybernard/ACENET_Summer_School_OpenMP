One of the classic problems in parallel programming is linear algebra, in all of its beauty and complexity. We will be using a couple of simple problems in order to see how we can spread work out around whatever compute resources you may have available, and how OpenMP can make this task easier.

## Multiply an array by a constant

The simplest problem is applying some function to an array of numbers. An example would be multiplying each value by some constant number. In C, you would use a for loop to do this multiplication for each entry. A single threaded example would look like the following.

~~~
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
   struct timespec ts_start, ts_end;
   int size = 1000000;
   int multiplier = 2;
   int a[size];
   int c[size];
   int i;
   float time_total;
   clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts_start);
   for (i = 0; i<size; i++) {
      c[i] = multiplier * a[i];
   }
   clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts_end);
   time_total = (ts_end.tv_sec - ts_start.tv_sec)*1000000000 + (ts_end.tv_nsec - ts_start.tv_nsec);
   printf("Total time is %f ms\n", time_total/1000000);
}
~~~

We added some calls to 'clock_gettime()' from the 'time.h' header file to get the start and end times of the heavy work being done by the for loop. In this case, we get a count of how many seconds and how many nanoseconds elapsed, given in two parts of the time structure. We did some math to get the elapsed time in milliseconds.

How complicated is it to turn this program into a parallel program?

~~~
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
   struct timespec ts_start, ts_end;
   int size = 1000000;
   int multiplier = 2;
   int a[size];
   int c[size];
   int i;
   float time_total;
   clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts_start);
   #pragma omp parallel for
   for (i = 0; i<size; i++) {
      c[i] = multiplier * a[i];
   }
   clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts_end);
   time_total = (ts_end.tv_sec - ts_start.tv_sec)*1000000000 + (ts_end.tv_nsec - ts_start.tv_nsec);
   printf("Total time is %f ms\n", time_total/1000000);
}

> Don't forget to add the option '-fopenmp' to your GCC compiler command.
{: .callout}

Here, we added a line to include the header file 'omp.h' and a line to include the 'parallel for' pragma.

> ## Using more threads
> What happens to the runtime when you change the number of threads to be used?
{: .challenge}

In this case, the number of iterations around the for loop gets divided across the number of threads available. In order to do this, however, OpenMP needs to know how many iterations there are in the for loop. It also can't change part way through the loops. How can this happen? You can't change the value of 'size' within one of the iterations. You also can't use a call to 'break()' or 'exit()' within the for loop, either. These functions pop you out of the for loop before it is done.

## Summing the values in a matrix

Moving up to a 2D matrix adds a new layer of looping. The basic code looks like the following.

~~~
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
   struct timespec ts_start, ts_end;
   int size = 1000;
   int multiplier = 2;
   int i,j, total;
   float time_total;
   int a[size][size];
   for (i=0; i<size; i++) {
      for (j=0; j<size; j++) {
         a[i][j] = 1;
      }
   }
   int c[size];
   for (i=0; i<size; i++) {
      c[i] = 0;
   }
   clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts_start);
   #pragma omp parallel for
   for (i = 0; i<size; i++) {
      for (j=0; j<size; j++) {
         c[i] = c[i] + a[i][j];
      }
   }
   total = 0;
   for (i=0; i<size; i++) {
      total = total + c[i];
   }
   clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts_end);
   time_total = (ts_end.tv_sec - ts_start.tv_sec)*1000000000 + (ts_end.tv_nsec - ts_start.tv_nsec);
   printf("Total is %d, time is %f ms\n", total, time_total/1000000);
}

> ## Does OpenMP handle multiple nested loops correctly?
> > ## Solution
> > All of the threads within an OpenMP program actually exist within a single process. This means that every thread can see and access all of memory for the process. In the above case, this means that multiple threads are all accessing the global variable j at the same time. OpenMP includes a method to manage this correctly with the addition of a keyword, private.

This leads to a very important idea, the concept of reentrant functions. You need to be aware when writing multi-threaded programs whether functions you are using are reentrant or not. A classic example where this happens is when generating random numbers. These functions maintain state between calls to them. If they aren't written to be reentrant, then that internal state can get mixed up by multiple threads calling them at the same time.

## Changing the number of threads at runtime

We have been setting the number of threads to be used with an environment variable. There is also a function available to do this from within your code.

~~~
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
   struct timespec ts_start, ts_end;
   int size = 1000000;
   int multiplier = 2;
   int a[size];
   int c[size];
   int i;
   float time_total;
   omp_set_num_threads(10);
   clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts_start);
   #pragma omp parallel for
   for (i = 0; i<size; i++) {
      c[i] = multiplier * a[i];
   }
   clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts_end);
   time_total = (ts_end.tv_sec - ts_start.tv_sec)*1000000000 + (ts_end.tv_nsec - ts_start.tv_nsec);
   printf("Total time is %f ms\n", time_total/1000000);
}

Here we added a call to 'omp_set_num_threads()' in order to explicitly set the number of threads requested to 10.

> ## Compiler gotchas
> This call is one of the optional ones. You particular compiler/version may or may not support it.
> If it doesn't support the call, it will simply fail silently, allowing your program to finish.
